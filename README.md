# Image Analysis Workshop 2023

Welcome to the image analysis workshop organized by the Live Cell Imaging facility at the Karolinska Institute! During this workshop we will:

* See typical examples of what can be done with image analysis and the limitations for each example
* Understand the principles of image analysis: digital images, pre-processing, segmentation, post-processing, etc
* Understand which image artefacts can be corrected by image analysis in some cases but are easier to correct before acquisition, e.g., uneven illumination
* Understand which image artefacts cannot be corrected by image analysis, e.g., saturation, underexposure, bleedthrough
