# :microscope: Image Analysis Workshop 2023

Welcome to the image analysis workshop organized by the Live Cell Imaging facility at the Karolinska Institute! During this workshop you will:

- [x] See typical examples of what can be done with image analysis and the limitations of each example
- [x] Understand which image artefacts can be corrected by image analysis in some cases but are easier to correct before acquisition, e.g., uneven illumination
- [x] Understand which image artefacts cannot be corrected by image analysis, e.g., saturation, underexposure, bleedthrough

In order to follow-up the examples presented in this workshop, download the code available in this GitHub page (you can do that by clicking on the green buttom above). In addition, you also have to download Fiji from the following [link](https://fiji.sc/). The installation of additional required plugins will be detailed in the next sessions.

## :alarm_clock: Schedule

* **10:00-11:00** Correction of uneven illumination
* **11:10-12:00** Handling noise
* **12:00-13.00** Lunch break
* **13:00-14:20** Image artifacts that cannot be fixed
* **14:20-15:00** Show-case image analysis tasks using the students images

## :muscle: Let's start!

## 1) Uneven illumination - how to correct

Uneven illumation can be due to different factors, e.g., microscope settings, samples artifacts (amples that are not flat), etc. 

## 2) How to handle noise
